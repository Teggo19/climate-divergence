We have that the amount of radiation entering the atmosphere is equal to the amount of radiation energy flux times the area. Since earth is approximately a sphere, where the radius is much smaller than the distance from the sun, the energy received from the sun will be approximately equal to that of a disc with radius $r$ placed orthogonally to the direction of the rays, at about the same distance from the sun. This will then have are $\pi r^2$. Since the area of the earth itself is $4\pi r^2$ we get that on average, each square meter will get one quarter of the total radiation from the sun at this distance from the sun.
