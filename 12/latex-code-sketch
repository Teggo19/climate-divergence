We have that if $N \neq -k(k+1)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$, that if a nonzero linear combination of these solutions has a derivative that converges in $x=1$ the derivative does not converge in $x=-1$. This is because we then have that one or both of $a_0$ and $a_1$ are nonzero, that if $a_{n}$ is nonzero that $a_{n+2}$ is nonzero. Furthermore for sufficiently high $n$, we have that the sign of $a_n$ and $a_{n+2}$ is the same, and that $a_{n+2}>\frac{n-1}{n+2}a_n$. This implies that $(n+2)a_{n+2}>\frac{n-1}{n} na_n$. Hence we get that for sufficiently high $n$, $a_{2n}$ and $a_{2n+1}$ will have different signs as we otherwise would have that the derivative would would not exist in $x=1$. However, this implies that $a_{2n}(-1)^{2n}$ and $a_{2n+1}(-1)^{2n+1}$ will have the same sign, and hence it diverges in $x=-1$. Thus we get that $N=-k(k+1)$. 

For $N = -k(k+1)$, we get that the Legendre polynomial of degree $k$ works. Hence we get that the admissible eigenvalues are $-k(k+1) -something someting$. We have that the Legendre polynomials are complete in the interval $[-1, 1]$. Since we demand that any $\delta T(0, x)$ must be continuous and differentiable in the interval $[0, 1]$, we then get that by writing $\delta T(0, x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty P_n(x)$, that $\delta T(t, x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty e^{-n(n+1) t}P_n(x)$, and hence it is asymptotically stable.
